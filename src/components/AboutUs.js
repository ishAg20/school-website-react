          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2001, The Heritage School aims to provide quality
            education that balances academic achievement with overall
            development. We believe that education extends beyond the confines
            of traditional academics. Our philosophy is rooted in the pursuit of
            knowledge, personal growth, and community involvement. We strive to
            create an environment where students are not only challenged
            intellectually but also supported in their emotional and social
            development.

            students to become well-rounded individuals who are not only
            academically proficient but also emotionally resilient and socially
            responsible. We believe in a holistic approach to education that
            integrates intellectual growth with the development of character and
            leadership skills."
