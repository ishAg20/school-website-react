        <h1>The Heritage School</h1>
        <p>
          The Heritage School, founded in 2001 by the Kalyan Bharti Trust,
          revives India's ancient Gurukul tradition. Set amidst nature, it
          fosters holistic growthâ€”physical, mental, social, and intellectual.
          Committed to transcending traditional boundaries, the school offers
          diverse curricula, including ICSE, ISC, IGCSE, and IBDP, to cultivate
          global citizens. Renowned as a leading international day-boarding
          school, it stands out in Kolkata and nationwide.
